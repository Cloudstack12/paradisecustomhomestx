                    My name is Turner Bowman. I have been building homes in the Texas Hill Country since 1999. I am a native Texan and have lived in San Antonio my entire life.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I represent the third generation of home builders in my family, as my father, Bubba Bowman, and my great uncle, Pete Turner, started building homes here in the early 1940’s. These hard-working men with impeccable integrity taught me that hard work and honesty would always be a great formula for success.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Their formula for success back then still rings true for me today.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    My oldest daughter, Brennan, now represents the fourth generation of builders in our family. Brennan is a recent studio art graduate from the University of Texas. Her unique creative eye for the arts has proven very successful in her leading the interior design and selection team for Paradise.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    As a leadership team, I oversee the construction of your home, and Brennan oversees the interior design as well as the interior and exterior selections for your home. Together, we can bring your home building dream to reality.

                    At Paradise, we understand your custom home will be the most important purchase you will ever make. We will only use the highest quality materials and trusted professionals to work on your home. These valued contractors have been members of our winning team for many years. The favorable relationships we have with our vendors and suppliers assure you that you will always receive the highest quality materials and fixtures available at the most affordable price.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    All of our foundations are designed, engineered, and inspected by a licensed structural engineer. Your concrete foundation will always have a minimum strength of 3000 psi.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The framing of our custom homes is hand built on site using a method called “Stick Built” framing. This gives your home more structural stability and allows us to enhance your home with many custom features like ceiling treatments, arches, and niches
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Our framing is inspected by a licensed third-party inspector.

                    Thank you so much for considering Paradise to build your custom home. We are a small builder that only builds 8 to 12 homes a year. This enables us to personally oversee all phases of the building process, from clearing your lot to handing over the keys at completion. I understand the magnitude of this investment and I assure you that you will not be disappointed. I promise to build you the best home possible at a price you can afford and in a way that is fun and doesn’t make you feel stressed.
                </p>
